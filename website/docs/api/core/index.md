# @orbit/core

A core set of primitives for performing, tracking, and responding to
asynchronous tasks, including:

- An event system that allows listeners to engage with the fulfillment of
  events by returning promises.

- An asynchronous task processing queue.

- A log that tracks a history of changes and allows for revision and
  interrogation.

- A bucket interface for persisting state. Used by logs and queues.
