# @orbit/memory

An in-memory data source that supports complex querying and updating. Because
memory sources maintain data in immutable data structures, they can be efficiently
forked. Forked sources can diverge from the master source, and then any changes
can be merged later.

Install with yarn:

```
yarn add @orbit/memory
```

Or with npm:

```
npm install @orbit/memory
```
