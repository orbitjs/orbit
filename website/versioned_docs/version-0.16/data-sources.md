title: Data sources

Sources provide access to data. They vary widely in their capabilities: some
support interfaces for updating and/or querying records, while others simply
broadcast changes.

Orbit includes a number of "standard" sources:

- [@orbit/memory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbit/memory) - an in-memory source
- [@orbit/jsonapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbit/jsonapi) - a JSON API client
- [@orbit/indexeddb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbit/indexeddb) - for accessing IndexedDB databases
- [@orbit/local-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbit/local-storage) - for accessing LocalStorage

Custom sources can also be written to access to virtually any source of data.

## Base class

Every source derives from an abstract base class, `Source`, which has a core
set of capabilities.

Sources must be instantiated with a schema. A schema provides sources with an
understanding of the domain-specific data they manage.

Let's create a simple schema and memory source:

```javascript
import { Schema } from "@orbit/data";
import MemorySource from "@orbit/memory";

// Create a schema
const schema = new Schema({
  models: {
    planet: {
      attributes: {
        name: { type: "string" },
        classification: { type: "string" }
      }
    }
  }
});

// Create a memory source that uses the schema
const memory = new MemorySource({ schema });
```

All sources can be mutated, although not all sources support _requests_ to
mutate. Some sources may only reflect mutations that come from elsewhere, such
as a source that wraps server-sent events.

Because all mutations in Orbit are trackable, sources maintain a log of changes,
or "transforms". This log represents an ordered history of transforms that have
been applied to a source. The size of this log can be kept in check by
truncating it after related sources have been synchronized.

Sources are also all "evented", meaning that they can emit events which
listeners can subscribe to. All sources support an event, `transform`, that is
emitted when that source changes. Most sources emit additional events as well
(the specifics depend upon their capabilities).

Let's look at an example of a simple mutation triggered by a call to `update`:

```javascript
// Define a record
const jupiter = {
  type: "planet",
  id: "jupiter",
  attributes: {
    name: "Jupiter",
    classification: "gas giant"
  }
};

// Observe and log all transforms
memory.on("transform", t => {
  console.log("transform", t);
});

// Check the size of the transform log before updates
console.log(`transforms: ${memory.transformLog.length}`);

// Update the memory source with a transform that adds a record
memory
  .update(t => t.addRecord(jupiter))
  .then(() => {
    // Verify that the transform log has grown
    console.log(`transforms: ${memory.transformLog.length}`);
  });
```

The following should be logged as a result:

```javascript
"transforms: 0",
  "transform",
  {
    operations: [
      {
        op: "addRecord",
        record: {
          type: "planet",
          id: "jupiter",
          attributes: {
            name: "Jupiter",
            classification: "gas giant"
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    options: undefined,
    id: "05e5d20e-02c9-42c4-a083-99662c647fd1"
  },
  "transforms: 1";
```

## Standard interfaces

Orbit includes a number of standard interfaces that may be implemented by
sources:

- `Updatable` - Allows sources to be updated via an `update` method that takes
  a transform and returns the updated records that result.

- `Queryable` - Allows sources to be queried via a `query` method that receives
  a query expression and returns a recordset as a result.

- `Pushable` - Allows sources to be updated via a `push` method that takes a
  transform and returns the results of the change and its side effects as an
  array of transforms.

- `Pullable` - Allows sources to be queried via a `pull` method that takes a
  query expression and returns the results as an array of transforms.

- `Syncable` - Applies a transform or transforms to a source via a `sync`
  method.

### Events

All of the interfaces above emit events that share a common pattern. For an
interface with a given method `x`, the following events will be emitted:
`beforeX`, `x`, and `xFail`. For example, updatable sources have an `update`
method and can emit `beforeUpdate`, `update`, and `updateFail` events.

In addition, any mutations caused by calling `x` will also be emitted with the
general `transform` event.

Processing occurs as follows (feel free to substitute `update`, `query`, etc.
for `x`):

1. `x` is called on a source.

2. The `beforeX` event is emitted by the source. Any promises that are returned
   from listeners will be settled serially. Any errors encountered will prevent
   further processing and cause the source to emit the `xFail` event.

3. `x` is processed internally by the source. Any errors encountered will
   prevent further processing and cause the source to emit the `xFail` event.

4. The `transform` event is emitted if `x` resulted in any mutations. Any
   promises that are returned from listeners will be settled serially. Errors
   will NOT prevent further processing.

5. The `x` event is emitted. Any promises that are returned
   from listeners will be settled serially. Errors will NOT prevent further
   processing.

There's a clear turning point after `x` has been processed internally by the
source. While listeners can block processing of `x` in the `beforeX` event by
returning a promise that fails, after `x` has been processed such failures will
be ignored by the emitter.

### Data flows

The `Updatable`, `Queryable`, `Pushable`, and `Pullable` interfaces all
participate in the "request flow", in which requests are made upstream and data
flows back down.

The `Syncable` interface participates in the "sync flow", in which data flowing
downstream is synchronized with other sources.

### Developer-facing interfaces

Generally speaking, only the `Updatable` and `Queryable` interfaces are designed
to be used directly by developers in most applications. The other interfaces are
used to coordinate data requests and synchronization between sources.
