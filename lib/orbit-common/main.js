/**
 The Orbit Common library (namespaced `OC` by default) defines a common set of
 compatible sources.

 The Common library contains a base abstract class, `Source`, which supports
 both `Transformable` and `Requestable` interfaces. The method signatures on
 `Source` should be supported by other sources that want to be fully compatible
 with the Common library.
