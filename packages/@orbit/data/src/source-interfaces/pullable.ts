 *
 * A pullable source emits the following events:
 *
 * - `beforePull` - emitted prior to the processing of `pull`, this event
 * includes the requested `Query` as an argument.
 *
 * - `pull` - emitted after a `pull` has successfully been requested, this
 * event's arguments include both the requested `Query` and an array of the
 * resulting `Transform` instances.
 *
 * - `pullFail` - emitted when an error has occurred processing a `pull`, this
 * event's arguments include both the requested `Query` and the error.
 *
 * A pullable source must implement a private method `_pull`, which performs
 * the processing required for `pull` and returns a promise that resolves to an
 * array of `Transform` instances.
