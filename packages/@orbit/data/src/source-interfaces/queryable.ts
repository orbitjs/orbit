 *
 * - `beforeQuery` - emitted prior to the processing of `query`, this event
 * includes the requested `Query` as an argument.
 *
 * - `query` - emitted after a `query` has successfully returned, this event's
 * arguments include both the requested `Query` and the results.
 *
 * - `queryFail` - emitted when an error has occurred processing a query, this
 * event's arguments include both the requested `Query` and the error.
 *
 * A queryable source must implement a private method `_query`, which performs
 * the processing required for `query` and returns a promise that resolves to a
 * set of results.
